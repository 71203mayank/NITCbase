# Overview
**NITCBase** is a compact Database Management System developed as a part of the university's DBMS Laboratory course. Designed for learning and experimentation, it provides users with the ability to execute fundamental database functionalities. This README serves as a guide to setting up and operating NITCBase.

# Getting Started
Follow the steps below to install and run NITCBase.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local environment:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/NITCBase.git
   ```

3. Move into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd NITCBase/mynitcbase
   ```

4. Build the project using the ``make`` command:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   If any errors arise during the build process, install the missing dependencies and try again.

## Launching NITCBase
Once successfully built, you can start NITCBase with the following command:
  ```bash
  ./nitcbase
  ```
This will open a command-line interface for interacting with the system.

## Usage
NITCBase supports basic SQL-like commands for managing data. Interact with the system by typing commands directly into the terminal. For comprehensive information on supported commands, refer to the [official documentation](https://nitcbase.github.io/).
